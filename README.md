# genmod
Unconditional MNIST implementations of DDPM, VDM, EDM, and PFGM++. Working on Consistency Models, and Cold Diffusion next. All code is in Pytorch Lightning.
I have tried to maintain naming conventions across different implementations for uniformity and to highlight the differences between each method.
Aiming for a toy repo for the diffusion model family.
