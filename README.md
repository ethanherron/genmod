# genmod
Unconditional MNIST implementations of DDPM, VDM, and EDM. Working on PFGM++, Consistency Models, and Cold Diffusion. All code is in Pytorch Lightning.
I have tried to maintain naming conventions across different implementations for uniformity and to highlight the differences between each method.
Aiming for an educational version of the almighty lucidrains diffusion repo: https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch
