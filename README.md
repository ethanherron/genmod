# genmod
Unconditional MNIST implementations of DDPM, VDM, EDM, and PFGM++. Working on Consistency Models, and Cold Diffusion next. All code is in Pytorch Lightning.
I have tried to maintain naming conventions across different implementations for uniformity and to highlight the differences between each method.
Aiming for a toy repo for the diffusion model family.


Rectified flow model .ipynb is from https://github.com/gnobitab/RectifiedFlow/tree/main example colab. 
UNetModel is from https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion/tree/main.


It started out as what is described above, but quickly descended into a dumpster fire of random little ideas I wanted to try out.
